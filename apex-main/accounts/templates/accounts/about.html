    <!-- Objective -->

    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Objective</h2>

    <p class="lead">Passwords are ubiquitous today on any platform, on possibly
        any website. But to remember so difficult passwords and that too on
        numerous websites seems daunting and therefore you can devise a project
        illustrating graphical password strategy.</p>
    <p class="lead">To provide users a graphical password authentication system
        where instead of creating a alphanumeric password a user has to select
        graphical objects in a particular order to keep it as their
        password. </p>
    <p class="lead">This will allow the user to set passwords in the form of
        graphical presentation in a certain pattern and later use that pattern
        to login to the system. </p>

    <!-- OUR PROJECT -->
    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Our Solution</h2>

    <p class="lead">We propose a graphical password authentication system.
        Research has shown that graphical objects or images are more easier to
        remember. Human brain tends to storage visual information for a longer
        period of time as compared to alphanumeric series.</p>
    <p class="lead">In our solution, users must select specific icons from a the
        grid in a sequence. The icons are displayed on the screen in a tab.
        Users will choose icons from two separate tabs. The values assigned to
        the selected icons will be combined to create a passcode value, which
        will be saved in the database along with the username. In our solution,

        combined to create a passcode value, which will be saved in the database
        along with the username. To generate the passkey we have used PBKDF2.
        PBKFD2(Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2), is recommended from
        National Institute of Standards and Technology. It is used to reduce
        vulnerabilities of brute force. </p>
